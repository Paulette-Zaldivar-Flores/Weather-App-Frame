# Weather-App
For my second project as a third month coding student I was asked to code the wire frame of a weather app that I designed. I coded this wire frame using Bootstrap, HTML and CSS. This is my first time working with Bootstrap and this project took me days ðŸ˜“. I find Bootstap a little difficult to work with at the moment but I can see the potential if I am patient with myself.
I am currently still working on this weather app and was inspired by the cool Tokyo city lights.
